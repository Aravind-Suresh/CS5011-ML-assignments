Step1: Feature Extraction
--------------------------
You are given a set of scene images. In this step, the requirement is to extract some features from the images that can be used as input to our LR model. 
There are many feature extraction techniques. For this assignment, we will follow a color histogram based approach. 
This is not the best technique for feature extraction, but most likely, the easiest. 
    
    How to: (matlab)
    --------
1. Read the image into a variable using imread(). Eg: im=imread('filename')
2. Extract red, green and blue channels from the variable you read into in 1. The sequence is r-g-b. Eg: r=im(:,:,1)
3. For every channel divide it into 32 bins and find frequency using imhist(). Eg. f1=imhist(r,32)
4. Concatenate these 32 dimensional feature vectors for every channel to find a 96D vector for the whole image. (sequence r-g-b)
5. Use this vector for carrying out the Logistic Regression 

    How to: (python)
    --------
1. Read the data input an object:

from PIL import Image
import glob

image_list = []
for filename in glob.glob('Train/*.jpg'):
    im=Image.open(filename)
    data = im.getdata()
    image_list.append(im)
    print(data[0]) # RGB values for 0th pixel
    print(im.size) # size of image (height, width)
    
2. Follow the same instructions as above with data as the image data.

Note that data_students has a script for generating data out of raw images in the format expected by
Prof Boyd's code. This script just generates data in the format described above. Students can make
modifications if they wish to. Or use other scripts.
